# Light-transe-machine

This is a 4 LED channels, 4 oscillators light transe machine. It runs on Arduino Mega 2560. You need Arduino 1.8 to compile. All required libraries are packaged.
The machine is compatible with PandoraStar light programs syntax. Either you find some programs on the web or you'll need to write them.


Light program syntax : 
TO DO

Hardware :
You'll need 
- to build or buy a 4 channel LED driver and connect it to outputs 3,5,6 & 9 of your Mega. I have used 'Arduino Uno 4 channel led shield 3 currents can be set 0,35-0,7-1A'
- LEDs. I have used '3W 3 Watt 3.0V-4.0V DC High Power Star Warm White LED' 

Warning : be careful with LEDs, it can damage your eyes. Do not stare at the LEDs directly until :
- you are sure about having filtered UVs
- you made sure the light power is adapted to human eyes
- you have put a light difuser in front of each LED
